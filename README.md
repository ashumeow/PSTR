PSTR
====

PSTR is an abbreviation for PRESENTER(sounds awkward, huh?). PRESENTER is a utility program with the aim of helping developers present their codes to the general audience. It was inspired by the (not-so) popular Linux utility program pv, especially when combined with the '-qL 10' switch, it outputs the text/code file piped to it to the standard output. This can be useful in some other ways, like when showcasing your code to a group of students, friends or colleagues. The program with the right switches, starts displaying the code in the text file and may automatically pause at a specified time given to the CLP or continue displaying the text file until SPACEBAR is hit. It can also be used like a screensaver, it shows a borderless/fullscreen window and immediately starts to "type" out all source code files specified during installation.

What's been done so far?
========================
As at Thursday(30th January 2014).
I've finished with the command-line parser(CLP) and with getting all text files out of a given folder(recursively down the directory). The CLP source code is attributed to Th√©ophile BASTIAN (a.k.a. Tobast), on his wonderful work on the CLI of pastebin source code. The FileHandler code handles the names of all the files in a given directory.

Platform
========
The utility program is(was) written on Ubuntu Linux 13.04(x86 arch), with GCC 4.7.1 installed. Tinydir is used for file management. The code is C++11 all through, therefore remember to turn the appropriate "switches on" before compilation.
